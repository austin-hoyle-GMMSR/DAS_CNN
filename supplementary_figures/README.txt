This repository is serves as the supplementary materials for Hoyle et al., 2025 TITLE

These supplementary materials consist of two primary sections:

1) An appenedix containing additional materials for earthquake signals detected by the convolutional 
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025. Further information can be found in the README in the folder 
"cataloged".

2) An appendix containing additional materials for seismic signals detected by the convolutional    
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025, but could not be associated with a cataloged seismic event 
(earthquakes and blasts). Further information can be found in the README in the folder 
"uncataloged".
