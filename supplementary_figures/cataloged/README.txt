This appenedix contains additional materials for earthquake signals detected by the convolutional
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025. These earthquake signals were found to be a result of cataloged 
events. 

The file "earthquake_metadata.png" provides earthquake metadata for each event. Additional materials 
for each event can be found in the folder corresponding to the "row number". 

Each folder contains various images:
	- A figure of the sesimic signals detected by the fiber optic cable
	- A figure containing a spectrogram of one of the fiber optic's channels
	- Figures containing the same signals being detected by nearby strong motion seismic stations  

All data have been selectively bandpass filtered using ranges that most amplify the signal to noise 
ratio.
