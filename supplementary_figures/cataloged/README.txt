This appenedix contains additional materials for earthquake signals detected by the convolutional
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025. These earthquake signals were found to be previously cataloged 
events. 

The file "earthquake_metadata.png" provides earthquake metadata for each event. Additional materials 
for each event can be found in the folder corresponding to the "row number". 

Each folder contains various images:
	- A figure of the sesimic signals detected by the fiber optic cable (time 0 is cataloged earthquake event time)
	- Figures containing the same time window of data from a nearby strong motion seismic stations (time 0 is cataloged 
          earthquake event time)
	- A figure containing a spectrogram of one of the fiber optic's channels (time 0 is trace start time)

All data have been selectively bandpass filtered using ranges that most amplify the signal to noise 
ratio.
