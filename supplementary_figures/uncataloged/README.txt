This appendix contains additional materials for seismic signals detected by the convolutional
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025, but could not be associated with a cataloged seismic event
(earthquakes and blasts). 

All 15 seismic events that could not be associated with a cataloged earthquake or blast are listed in the PDF in this folder. These events could not be structured similarly to DASS_CNN/supplementary_figures/cataloged because each of these events do not have a fixed time 0 (no cataloged event time to tie it to). As such, this document lists all 15 events and shows the following information:
        - A figure of the sesimic signals detected by the fiber optic cable                   
        - A figure containing a spectrogram of one of the fiber optic's channels 
	- Figures containing the same time window of data from a nearby strong motion seismic stations
        - A table showing cataloged events that occured close in time to the observed signal in the DAS data. We pick P-wave and
          S-wave arrivals and use average sesimic velocities of the region to find the approximate arrival time to the fiber-optic
          cable. We then list the difference in time between this estimated arrivale and the actual observed arrival in the DAS data. 
          As an example, any time differnces listed at or near 0 s would indicate that the corressponding cataloged event caused the 
          signals observed in the DAS data. For the uncataloged events, however, no cataloged event arrivals match observed arrivals.

All data have been selectively bandpass filtered using ranges that most amplify the signal to noise  
ratio.
