This appendix contains additional materials for seismic signals detected by the convolutional
neural network in Hoyle et al., 2025, but could not be associated with a cataloged seismic event
(earthquakes and blasts). 

Each folder contains materials for an individual seismic event detected by the neural network. 

Each folder contains various images: 
        - A figure of the sesimic signals detected by the fiber optic cable             
        - A figure containing a spectrogram of one of the fiber optic's channels       
        - Figures containing the same signals being detected by nearby strong motion seismic stations

All data have been selectively bandpass filtered using ranges that most amplify the signal to noise  
ratio.
